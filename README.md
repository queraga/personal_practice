📦 Personal Practice

A monorepo containing my self-practice projects, experiments, and learning exercises across different technologies.
This repository helps me track progress, organize small educational builds, and keep everything in one place.

🧪 Projects

1. Light/Dark Theme Switcher

A small React app that demonstrates:
	•	using Context API
	•	global state management
	•	theme switching (light/dark)
	•	conditional styling
	•	functional components + hooks

📂 Located in:
selfpractice01-lightdarktheme/

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
	•	Track personal progress
	•	Practice individual concepts without creating many separate repos
	•	Build a library of solved exercises
	•	Experiment freely and safely
	•	Keep a clean, organized structure

📌 Notes
	•	Each project contains its own README.md
	•	Node modules are excluded via .gitignore
	•	Projects may use Vite, React, Vanilla JS, or other tools
